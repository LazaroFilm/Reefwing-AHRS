# Nexgen AHRS
 
 Our Magpie flight controller for quadcopters is based around the Arduino Nano 33 BLE board. This board includes the LSM9DS1 chip which we use as an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). In other words it determines the current orientation of the drone. 

 The Nexgen AHRS library provides an Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS) class for use with the Nano 33 BLE and the Nano 33 BLE SENSE.

 The AHRS will convert the gyroscope rate and accelerometer force data to a roll and pitch angle. The yaw angle is then calculated using the pitch, roll and magnetometer data. 

 ## Aircraft Reference Frame
 
 Any control system needs to use a defined reference frame. Being a drone application, we will use the convention for aircraft. This is based on three body co-ordinates and three attitude angles roll, pitch and yaw.

 The Aircraft Reference Frame (ARF) is relative to the drone itself and the origin is at the centre of gravity. Aircraft movement in the positive X, Y and Z directions translate to forward, right and down. In other words the positive X-Axis points towards the front of the drone.
 Rotation around the X, Y and Z-Axes are referred to as roll, pitch and yaw. The direction of positive rotation is defined by the co-ordinate right hand rule.

 Roll is defined as the angle between the Y Axis and the horizontal plane. When rotating the drone around the X Axis with the Y Axis moving downwards, roll is positive and increasing.

 Pitch is defined as the angle between the X Axis and the horizontal plane. When rotating the drone around the Y Axis with the X Axis moving upwards, pitch is positive and increasing.

 Yaw is defined as the angle between the X Axis and magnetic north on the
 horizontal plane measured in a clockwise direction when viewing from the top of the drone.

 The aircraft reference frame is useful in a piloted flight control context, since we want command inputs to be in reference to the current drone position and attitude.

 ## World Reference Frame

 Another possible reference frame is the world or ground. In this frame, the origin is defined as a location on Earth (e.g., the drone take off longitude, latitude and altitude) and the X, Y and Z-Axes correspond to North, East and Down. You may see this described as NED.

Heading is similar to yaw and defined as the angle between the X Axis and magnetic north on the horizontal plane measured in a clockwise direction when viewing from the top of the drone. Thus, a heading angle of 0¬∞ will point towards the North, and +90¬∞ towards the East.

The key difference between the Aircraft Reference Frame and the World Reference Frame is the origin. They can initially be the same point but once the drone moves, the co-ordinates will be different.

The World Reference Frame is useful in flight planning or return to home failsafe scenarios where we need to know the location of the drone and where it came from. For any sort of accuracy you will need to complement the IMU with a GPS for this type of mission. Some filter libraries (e.g., Madgewick fusion algorithm) also expect co-ordinates in the NED format.
 
## Inertial Navigation

Without a GPS, a drone relies on inertial navigation or dead reckoning to determine its position, velocity and orientation. It does this using an IMU to provide data to the Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS), which is part of the flight controller. The AHRS includes some sort of filtering or sensor fusion to deliver the most accurate roll, pitch and yaw data possible. Precision gyroscopes (e.g., ring lasers), are too expensive and bulky for drone applications and so less accurate MEMS (Micro Electrical Mechanical System) devices like the LSM9DS1 are used.

## The LSM9DS1 IMU

The LSM9DS1 is manufactured by STMicroelectronics (now known as ST). It has a 3D digital linear acceleration sensor, a 3D digital angular rate sensor (gyroscope), and a 3D digital magnetic sensor. It includes SPI and I2C (standard 100 kHz and fast mode 400 kHz) serial interfaces but the Arduino Nano 33 BLE uses I2C. Full details of this chip are available in the [LSM9DS1 data sheet](https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/lsm9ds1.pdf).

A gyroscope is a device that can measure the orientation and angular velocity of an object. Gyroscopes are more advanced than accelerometers, in that they can measure the tilt and lateral orientation, whereas an accelerometer can only measure its linear motion. Gyroscope sensors are also called ‚ÄúAngular Rate Sensors‚Äù or ‚ÄúAngular Velocity Sensors‚Äù. Angular velocity (measured in degrees per second) is the change in the rotational angle of the object per unit of time.

An accelerometer is an electromechanical device used to measure acceleration forces. Such forces may be static, like the continuous force of gravity or, as with a drone accelerating, dynamic to sense movement or vibrations. Changes in the acceleration force measured in the 3-axis directions can be used to determine the orientation of a drone. Accelerometer sensors are insensitive to rotation about the earth‚Äôs gravitational field vector.

A magnetometer is an instrument used for measuring magnetic forces, and in our context, the earth‚Äôs magnetism. The Earth‚Äôs magnetic field is a 3-dimensional vector that, like gravity, can be used to determine long-term orientation. The typical magnitude of the Earth‚Äôs magnetic field is between 20 ¬µT and 70 ¬µT.

 ## Examples

 ### 1. IMU Configuration

The `imuConfig.ino` sketch will test if the gyroscope, magnetometer and accelerometer are connected via I2C. It does this by reading the value of the `WHO AM I` register and comparing this with the expected value. The expected values are defined as follows for the gyro/accelerometer, magnetometer and barometer. Note that a barometer is only fitted to the Nano 33 BLE SENSE board not the base Nano 33 BLE.

```c++
#define LSM9DS1XG_WHO_AM_I_VALUE    0x68
#define LSM9DS1M_WHO_AM_I_VALUE     0x3D
#define LPS22HB_WHO_AM_I_VALUE      0xB1
```

If the LSM9DS1 IMU is connected, the sketch will print out the Gyro chip temperature and default sensitivities for the three IMU sensors. The linear acceleration sensitivity is given in units of mg/LSB. This means milli-G's (1G = 9.8ms^-2) per Least Significant Bit. This is the smallest value that the sensor can return. Similarly, magnetic sensitivity is given in mGauss/LSB and angular rate sensitivity is mdps (milli degrees per second)/LSB. The sensitivity of the sensors depends on the full scale value selected (ref: Table 3 in the [LSM9DS1 Data Sheet](https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/lsm9ds1.pdf)).

An angular rate gyroscope is device that produces a positive-going digital output for counterclockwise rotation around the axis considered. Sensitivity describes the gain of the sensor. This value changes very little over temperature and time.
Magnetic sensor sensitivity also describes the gain of the sensor. 

### 2. Self Test and Calibration

Before you use an IMU for the first time, you need to calibrate it. The results wont be accurate if you don't do this. At the start of the self test, the Nano 33 BLE should be **level and not moving**.

#### 2.1 Gyroscope and Accelerometer

The LSM9DS1 includes a self test function that is not particularly well documented. To start the Gyro self-test, control register 10, bit ST_G needs to be set to 1. For the accelerometer, control register 10, bit ST_XL is set. The Nexgen AHRS library looks after this in the `selfTest` method. It calculates the average of the IMU at-rest readings and then loads these resulting offsets into the accelerometer and gyroscope bias registers.

An accelerometer in a steady state on a horizontal surface should measure 0 g on both the X-axis and Y-axis, whereas the Z-axis should measure 1 g. Ideally, the output is in the middle of the dynamic range of the sensor. A deviation from the ideal value is called a zero-g offset. Similarly, the gyro zero-rate level describes the actual output signal if there is no angular rate present and zero-gauss level offset describes the deviation of an actual output signal from the
ideal output if no magnetic field is present.

Offset is to some extent a result of stress to MEMS sensor and therefore the offset can slightly change after mounting the sensor onto a printed circuit board or exposing it to extensive mechanical stress. Offset changes little with temperature variation. 

From the [LSM9DS1 Data Sheet](https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/lsm9ds1.pdf), table 3, typical bias offsets are:

```
- Gyroscope (G_TyOff): ¬± 30 dps
- Accelerometer (LA_TyOff): ¬± 90 mg
- Magnetometer (M_TyOff): ¬± 1 gauss
```

This highlights the need for calibration. An uncorrected gyro offset of 30 degrees per second is material!

The results of the `selfTest()` function are loaded into a data structure, `SelfTestResults`, which is defined as:

```c++
struct SelfTestResults {
  float gyrodx;
  float gyrody;
  float gyrodz;
  float accdx;
  float accdy;
  float accdz;
};
```

A sensor will `PASS` the self test if these results are within the expected range:

- Gyroscope x, y and z axis expected range: 20 - 250 dps.
- Accelerometer x, y, and z axis expected range: 60 - 1700 mg.

#### 2.2 Magnetometer

The magnetometer included in the LSM9DS1 chip is the LIS3MDL. Its calibration is a bit different to the accelerometer and gyroscope. At the start of the magnetometer calibration, you will be asked to wave the Nano 33 BLE in a vertical figure of 8.

Since the magenetic field of the earth is relatively constant, the magnitude of the field measured by the magnetometer should also be constant, regardless of the orientation of the sensor. If one were to rotate the sensor and plot ùëöùë•, ùëöùë¶, and ùëöùëß in 3D, the paths should plot out the surface of a sphere with a constant radius.

In reality, due to hard and soft iron distortion, a 3D plot of magnetic field strength ends up as a deformed sphere. Calibration is used to adjust each of the three axis readings, so that the magnitude is constant regardless of orientation.

Performing the figure of 8 pattern 'traces out' part of our deformed sphere. From the coordinates obtained, the deformation of the sphere can be estimated, and the calibration coefficients calculated. A good pattern is one that traces through the greatest range of orientations and therefore estimates the greatest deviation from the true constant magnitude.

### 3. Roll, Pitch and Yaw Angles on Serial Port

Define output variables from updated quaternion---these are Tait-Bryan angles, commonly used in aircraft orientation.
In this coordinate system, the positive z-axis is down toward Earth. 
Yaw is the angle between Sensor x-axis and Earth magnetic North (or true North if corrected for local declination, looking down on the sensor positive yaw is counterclockwise.
Pitch is angle between sensor x-axis and Earth ground plane, toward the Earth is positive, up toward the sky is negative.
Roll is angle between sensor y-axis and Earth ground plane, y-axis up is positive roll.

These arise from the definition of the homogeneous rotation matrix constructed from quaternions.
Tait-Bryan angles as well as Euler angles are non-commutative; that is, the get the correct orientation the rotations must be applied in the correct order which for this configuration is yaw, pitch, and then roll.

For more see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_between_quaternions_and_Euler_angles.

With these settings the filter is updating at a ~145 Hz rate using the Madgwick scheme and 
>200 Hz using the Mahony scheme even though the display refreshes at only 2 Hz.
The filter update rate is determined mostly by the mathematical steps in the respective algorithms, 
the processor speed (8 MHz for the 3.3V Pro Mini), and the magnetometer ODR:
an ODR of 10 Hz for the magnetometer produce the above rates, maximum magnetometer ODR of 100 Hz produces
filter update rates of 36 - 145 and ~38 Hz for the Madgwick and Mahony schemes, respectively. 
This is presumably because the magnetometer read takes longer than the gyro or accelerometer reads.
This filter update rate should be fast enough to maintain accurate platform orientation for 
stabilization control of a fast-moving robot or quadcopter. 

#### Madgwick Sensor Fusion

There is a tradeoff in the beta parameter between accuracy and response speed. In the original Madgwick study, beta of 0.041 (corresponding to GyroMeasError of 2.7 degrees/s) was found to give optimal accuracy. However, with this value, the LSM9SD0 response time is about 10 seconds to a stable initial quaternion. Subsequent changes also require a longish lag time to a stable output, not fast enough for a quadcopter!

By increasing beta (GyroMeasError) by about a factor of fifteen, the response time constant is reduced to ~2 sec. We haven't noticed any reduction in solution accuracy. This is essentially the I coefficient in a PID control sense; the bigger the feedback coefficient, the faster the solution converges, usually at the expense of accuracy. In any case, this is the free parameter in the Madgwick filtering and fusion scheme.
